# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
* The variables that are considered the targets in this model are our “IS_SUCCESSFUL” column. 

What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
* The variables considered to be the features for this model are the input values.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
* The variables that should be removed are those that are not contributing to the  project.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* 2 layers were used because three just made the dataset more complicated. 

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* This was hard to determine but I beleive so 

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
* I tried to bring back the name column and just have 2 layers as well as increase the epochs

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation
* The random forest algorithm was the best to use as i beleive it gave the most accuate results . But I also dont think the model we used was best as there was soo much data and it almost well did make it more complicated and frustrating.
